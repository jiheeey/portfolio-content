      <h2>Hello, I'm Ji Hee<h2>
        <p id="intro">
          I grew up from an artistic family who encouraged me to observe, experience, and create the abstract beauties in life from an early age. 
          Very naturally, art has become my dedicated passion and it eventually became my career path to be pursued in college.
          At Pratt Institute in New York, I studied Communication Design with an emphasis in Graphic Design. 
          The dynamic, lively, and wild side of New York is always within me now, and my works from those days are here to reflect my experiences.
          <br>
          <br>
          After changing my career path towards User Experience Design, I don't get to revisit and reflect on my artistic works from the pass very often. 
          Although I enjoy creating practical solutions through my designs, I do also enjoy artistic visual thrills that is quite free from outside (customer) validations but is more focused on personal satisfaction. 
          I wanted to gather and document all the artworks I have done here, to further use this website as my personal repository of continuing arts practices! 
          If you're visiting this website from a professional or personal link, I hope you enjoy my works.
